pim was my personal answer to the question of my personal preferences;
minimalism or ease of us. Why not both? pim makes it easy to make amazing Neovim
using experiences, without sacrificing performance, mainly because _everything_
is lazily loaded, powered by the amazing
[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) package manager. After all, the
end goal of pim is to be used as a base framework, to be further extended on by
the end-user.

pim is designed to be fast and extensive; thus the following design principles
were applied:

- **Speed**: I made sure pim runs lightning fast, with a startup time aiming to
  be under ±60.0 ms (±48.0 since
  [0ae530a](https://github.com/therealnv6/pim/commit/0ae530aa58d31f7db7c97578c6d9c3c27b6b59d4)).
  As a developer myself, I understand the frustration of working with sluggish
  code editors.
- **Modularity**: pim is all about being modular and flexible. While I have my
  own opinions, I want you to have full control. You can easily overwrite my
  defaults and tailor pim to your liking. Take a look at
  [configuring.md](https://egirldev.gay)

## Features

- Lightweight and minimalistic Neovim setup
- Utilizes lazy loading with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for
  faster startup times
- Integrated Language Server Protocol (LSP) support using
  [lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)

But wait, there's more! Check out these additional features of pim:

- Sensible defaults: pim comes with carefully selected default configurations to
  enhance your editing experience out of the box.
- Extensibility: You can customize pim according to your preferences thanks to
  its modular architecture. Add or remove plugins, keybindings, and settings as
  you please.
- Plugin management with [mason](https://github.com/therealnv6/mason): Easily
  manage your plugins and keep them up to date with the help of mason.
- Easy navigation with [nvim-tree](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua):
  Access your file tree and navigate through your project effortlessly.
- Beautiful and informative status line with
  [lualine](https://github.com/hoob3rt/lualine.nvim): Customize your status line
  with various themes and useful information.
